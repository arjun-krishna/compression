Huffman compression Algorithm

text_analayse.cpp :
 takes an input file and outputs the character versus frequency of occurance which can be used by compress.cpp

compress.cpp
 uses : Huffman coding to compress text data
 usage :
 to compress : compress -c inputfile < frequency file>
 to decompress : compress -d inputfile <frequency file>
 <frequency file> -- OPTIONAL ( but needed in -d if used in -c mode )
